# OOSE LAB EXAM

The project is a text-based adventure game that randomly generates an open world for players to explore.

The game world is represented by a 2D grid of coordinates that are populated by various types of encounters.

The users have the option to set the grid size to any size starting from (2,2).

It follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm and utilizes various design patterns to achieve a robust and
scalable structure.

The Factory Method pattern is used to create different types of encounters in the game. The EncounterFactory abstract
class defines the method for creating an encounter, and its concrete subclasses implement this method to create
different types of encounters.

The Singleton pattern is used for the Player class to ensure that only one instance of the Player object exists
throughout the game.

The Observer pattern is used to notify the Player object of any changes in the Encounter objects within its proximity.
